The raincloud plots of the Raincloud Quartet are in the raincloudQuartet folder.
In there are not just the four plots but also a meanCi plot (not in the article),
that shows the identical means and confidence intervals next to each other.

design3x1 also covers two more plots that are not in the article but featured
in the YouTube tutorial. One shows means connected by lines,
the other shows subject trajectories and custom cloud orientations.

accessibleColorsCheck.R checks that all colors are accessible for colorblind people.
