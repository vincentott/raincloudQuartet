The raincloud plots of the Raincloud Quartet are in the raincloudQuartet folder.
In there are not just the four plots but also a meanCi plot (not in the article),
that shows the identical means and confidence intervals next to each other.

design3x1 also visualizes subject trajectories and custom cloud orientations.
This plot is not in the article but featured in the YouTube tutorial.
